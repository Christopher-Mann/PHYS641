I have submitted my assignment as (hopefully) clearly commented python code "my_LIGO_mf.py".
Figures are in their own folder.  They are organized by GW event.

I don't think you really need to run the code.  At the bottom of the script I have
included a commented version of the printout.  The figures and code comments 
should tell you the rest of the story.

If you DO want to run it, you need to set the 3 variables at the top:
    1) You probably want to keep makeplots=False since I've already provided plots for you
    2) data_location = <your_path>  to where you keep your LIGO data
    3) You need to run twice:
        - the first time you run, set which="H" (Hanford) and run
        - then do it with which="L"
