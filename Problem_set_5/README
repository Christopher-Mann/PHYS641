My assignment is in the form of 2 jupyter notebook files.  I don't know if you use juypter notebooks, 
so I also included HTML printouts of each.  The HTML printout will show you the outputs of each cell
without you having to run things.

File "cosmoparams" works through my building of an MCMC code to handle fitting WMAP power spectrum data
using 6 cosmological parameters.  It is well commented and you should be able to read through it linearly.

File "cosmoparams_ptsrc" is very similar, but works through the problem with 7 parameters, altering
certain functions to allow for the fitting of a_src, a point source parameter.

Some figures are shown right in the HTML output, while others (particularly those where I did several
iterations) are shown in the figures/ folder.

If you want to look at my chains, I've included the most important ones (I did several variations):
  "testchain_paramX.txt" are the 1D parameter explorations
  "chain_ALLparam_runX.txt" are the full MCMC runs using all parameters
  
Figures:
  - B_paramX_1d_curvature.png  :  1D chi^2 surface exporations
  - chain_overview_runX.png    :  plotting chain and chi^2 values for all params
  - cornerplot_runX.png        :  Corner plot of chain results and uncertainties.  Can see correlations here.
  - corr_overview_runX.png     :  Correlation length of chains.

Runs:
  - Run3  : 6 parameters, simple gaussian steps,   ~50,000 iters, corr length >2500, acceptance rate ~19%
  - Run8  : 6 parameters, correlated steps,        ~15,000 iters, corr length ~50,   acceptance rate ~61%
  - Run11 : 7 parameters, simple gaussian steps,   ~23,000 iters, corr length ~2500, acceptance rate ~21%
  - Run12 : 7 parameters, correlated steps (6of7), ~42,000 iters, corr length ~200,  acceptance rate ~30%
